## 🔐 Verify Releases

Release artifacts are published with SLSA provenance. After downloading `OneShot.zip`:

```bash
gh attestation verify OneShot.zip \
  --repo grantbirki/oneshot \
  --signer-workflow grantbirki/oneshot/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref refs/heads/main \
  --deny-self-hosted-runners
```

Minimal verification by owner:

```bash
gh attestation verify OneShot.zip --owner grantbirki
```

You can also verify the checksum:

```bash
shasum -a 256 OneShot.zip
```

## Unsigned Builds

OneShot releases are currently unsigned. macOS Gatekeeper may block the first launch.

To open it:

1) Right-click `OneShot.app` and choose Open.
2) Or go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click Open Anyway.

> Why? Apple Developer ID certs cost $99/year, and I don't want to pay Apple.
