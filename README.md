Open source screenshot utility for macOS with QoL improvements over the native Apple screenshot utility.

## 🎯 Goals

- Keep the capture flow simple and familiar.
- Add control over preview behavior, save timing, location, clipboard operations, and naming.
- Stay lightweight and focused.

## ✨ Features

- Selection, window, and full-screen capture.
- Floating preview with save/discard actions and drag-and-drop.
- Optional clipboard copy + configurable save location and filename prefix.
- Customizable hotkeys.
- Optional auto-dismiss preview with save delay control.
- Optional menu bar icon hiding (restore via Spotlight).

## 🚀 Installation

Homebrew (recommended):

```bash
brew install --cask grantbirki/tap/oneshot
```

If macOS says the app is damaged after install, remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OneShot.app
```

> Sadly, the app is unsigned, so Apple Gatekeeper quarantines the first launch. See [Unsigned Builds](#unsigned-builds) for details. The TL;DR is that I don't want to pay Apple $99/year for a Developer ID certificate.

## 📖 Usage

- End-user guide: [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md)
- Settings reference: [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md)

## 🔐 Verify Releases

Release artifacts are published with SLSA provenance. After downloading `OneShot.zip`:

```bash
gh attestation verify OneShot.zip \
  --repo grantbirki/oneshot \
  --signer-workflow grantbirki/oneshot/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref refs/heads/main \
  --deny-self-hosted-runners
```

Minimal verification by owner:

```bash
gh attestation verify OneShot.zip --owner grantbirki
```

You can also verify the checksum:

```bash
shasum -a 256 OneShot.zip
```

## Unsigned Builds

OneShot releases are currently unsigned. macOS Gatekeeper may block the first launch.

To open it:

1) Right-click `OneShot.app` and choose Open.
2) Or go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click Open Anyway.
3) If neither shows, remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OneShot.app
```

> Why? Apple Developer ID certs cost $99/year, and I don't want to pay Apple.
